        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chinese soup dumplings, sometimes referred to as Shanghai Soup Dumplings, xiaolongbao, tang bao, or "soupy buns", are a steamed dumpling consisting of a paper thin wrapper enveloping a seasoned pork filling and hot, flavorful soup. Each dumpling is pleated with many folds. Once steamed, the delicate dumplings are dipped in a mixture of Chinese black vinegar and julienned ginger for the perfectly balanced bite.</p>
